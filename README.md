# Student Record Management System (CLI - Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

**Task 2:** Create a CLI-based CRUD system for managing student records using Java.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a command-line interface application that allows users to:
- Add new student records
- View all records
- Update student details
- Delete records by ID

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Java (JDK)
- VS Code / IntelliJ CE
- Terminal / Command Prompt

---

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
StudentRecordSystem/
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ StudentRecordManager.java
â””â”€â”€ README.md


---

## âœ… What I Did

1. Created a main project folder named `StudentRecordSystem`.
2. Added a `src` directory to store source files.
3. Created a `StudentRecordManager.java` file containing:
   - A `Student` class with fields: ID, name, and marks.
   - An `ArrayList<Student>` to store and manage student records.
   - Menu-driven CLI with options to Add, View, Update, and Delete.
4. Compiled and ran the program using terminal.
5. Verified functionality of all CRUD operations.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Hints Followed

1. Created a `Student` class with encapsulated fields.
2. Used `ArrayList` to manage multiple student objects.
3. Implemented looping logic for continuous user interaction until exit.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Sample Menu
=== Student Record Management ===

1.Add Student
2.View Students
3.Update Student
4.Delete Student
5.Exit

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

- Practiced real-world data structure usage in Java.
- Reinforced understanding of:
  - Java classes and objects
  - Encapsulation using getters and setters
  - ArrayList for collection handling
  - Console-based interaction using loops and conditions

---

## ðŸ“Œ Deliverable

- Java program with class-based structure and menu options
- Source file: `StudentRecordManager.java`
